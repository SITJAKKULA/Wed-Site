          <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p>We have seen this on a smaller scale as AI Apps, Siri, Google Now and so forth. However, Artificial intelligence is coming on a much greater scale. It is said to be something that could help people in a big way in future. Some prominent AI projects ,as of now underway, include: Facebook’s AI lab: An ambitious new research lab with the objective of making a machine that can really work like a human brainchild and Google’s DeepMind start-up</p>

          <h4>Internet of Things(IoT)</h4>
          <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is an environment in which objects, animals or people are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. IoT has evolved from the convergence of wireless technologies, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and the Internet. The concept may also be referred to as the Internet of Everything.</p>
          <p>A thing, in the Internet of Things, can be a person with a heart monitor implant, a farm animal with a biochip transponder, an automobile that has built-in sensors to alert the driver when tire pressure is low -- or any other natural or man-made object that can be assigned an IP address and provided with the ability to transfer data over a network. So far, the Internet of Things has been most closely associated with machine-to-machine (M2M) communication in manufacturing and power, oil and gas utilities. Products built with M2M communication capabilities are often referred to as being smart</p>
